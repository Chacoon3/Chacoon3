I am a developer focusing on web full-stack, quantitative trading, and machine learning. 
I have 5 year experiences in software development, with C#, Python, and typescript being my primary languages. I have experiences building scalable app from scratch, architecting the whole system according to business requirements. 

See the links below for examples of my web fullstack works that are already in production deployment：
