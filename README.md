Thank you for reading.

I am a software developer with a <b>bachelor's degree of Arts in English Literature</b>!

I started actively learning topics related to Mathematics and Computer Science when I was a undergrad, feeling bored for the humannities disciplines which can hardly contribute to reality. 

I enjoy the feeling of solidifying intangible thoughts into reality through writing codes.
